        TNT also known as a block that you never want to see in your house is
        extremely useful for ruining someones day. If you don't already know,
        TNT explodes by activation of redstone or a source of fire. This
        explosion has some range and it detonates after around 3 seconds. This
        can be used to destroy chunks of blocks in an area but it's mainly used
        to blow people up or do speedruns. To craft such an item, you need 5
        Gunpowder and 4 sand. I have a quote from one of my experineces, "Don't
        worry it's not gonna light." everyone died after.
