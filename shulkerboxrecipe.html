        The shulker box is a unique block in minecraft which is capable of storing items while being an item.
        This block is often treated as a portable backpack/chest in which you can store up to 27 inventory slots.
        To craft this item, you require 2 shulker shells which drop from the endgame end islands from Shulkers.
        These Shulkers can be found in End cities and on flying ships too. With the 2 shulker shells, you also require a chest in the middle.
        The shulker box can also be dyed different colours which is a decorative feature. This is by far one of the coolest items 
        in minecraft.
